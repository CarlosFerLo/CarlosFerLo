I'm Carlos Fernandez, from Barcelona. I'm currently studying mathematics at Universidad de Barcelona, and I'm really enjoying it. 
I am of entrepeneurial nature, my main goal is to start my own company to make something valuable. 
Currently I am collaborating with Haystack from DeepSet while working on some side projects. 

If anyone wants to collaborate contact me!

I'm also interested in quantum computing and machine learning, but I will dig deeper in those areas when I have the proper knowledge to do so.

A pleasure,

Carlos
