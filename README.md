I'm Carlos Fernandez, from Barcelona. I'm currently studying mathematics at Universidad de Barcelona, and I'm really enjoying it. 
I am of entrepeneurial nature, my main goal is to start my own company to make something valuable. 
Currently I am working on my final year thesis about AI models that generate mathematical proofs.

A pleasure,

Carlos
