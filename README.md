I'm Carlos Fernandez, from Barcelona. I'm currently studying mathematics at Universidad de Barcelona, and I'm really enjoying it. I'm studying C programming at uni and I'm haveing fun so I decided to start studying it on my own.
I am of entrepeneurial nature, my main goal is to start my own company to make something valuable. Currently I am designing an algorithm to support independent value investors to analyse companies faster and better, if anyone interested wou can contact me.
I'm also interested in quantum computing, blockchain and machine learning, but I will dig deeper in those areas when I have the proper knowledge to do so.

A pleasure,

Carlos
