I'm Carlos Fernandez, from Barcelona. I'm currently studying mathematics at Universidad de Barcelona, and I'm really enjoying it. 
I am of entrepeneurial nature, my main goal is to start my own company to make something valuable. Currently I am working on my new project Synthetic Cogmition (check the [repo](https://github.com/carlosFerLo/synthetic) where we are developping a state of the art library to make agent development easy. If anyone wants to collaborate contact me!
I'm also interested in quantum computing and machine learning, but I will dig deeper in those areas when I have the proper knowledge to do so.

A pleasure,

Carlos
