I'm Carlos Fernandez, from Barcelona. I'm currently studying mathematics at Universidad de Barcelona.

I am currently researching on Autonomous Theorem Proving (which includes my final year thesis), here are some repos on some things I have done.
 - [Combinators Dataset](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/combinators-dataset)
 - [Combinators LLM](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/combinators-llm)
 - [Implica](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/implicational-logic-graph)
   
I have some public repos with the coding I did on some of my university courses:
 - [Elementos de Programaci√≥n](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/Elements-de-Programacio)
 - [Programaci√≥n Cient√≠fica](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/PrograCientifica)
 - [M√©todos Num√©ricos I](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/metodos-numericos)
 - [M√©todos Num√©ricos II](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/metodos-numericos-2)
 - [Anillos de Polinomios en Diversas Variables](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/anillos-de-polinomios)

The [transformer-lecture](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/transformer-lecture) repo contains interactive notes on a technical lecture I gave on coding and training transformer models.

I also have a half built package that reflects a my proposed framework for developping LLM-based agents.
It is not finished as I am currently foccussing on other work, but I will try and finish it one day.
 - [Synthetic Transformers](https://github.com/CarlosFerLo/synthetic-transformers)

A pleasure,

Carlos
